          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
          been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
          an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
          and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
          12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
          as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
